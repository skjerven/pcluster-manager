This enables many features within slurm, including job resource tracking and providing a necessary building block to slurm federation.
Step 1 - Setup External Accounting Database The first requirement is to setup an external database that Slurm can use to store the accounting data.
Use the following CloudFormation Quick-Create link to create the database in your AWS account. Note that if you would like to create the databas in a different region, change the value of the region parameter in the URL to the region of your choice and reload the page.</description></item></channel></rss>
